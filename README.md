# WebGL Version #
Since the tower upgrade panel opens by clicking on a tower, which is done by a raycast, there are problems in the WebGL version. It can happen that the raycast does not arrive. It works best in fullscreen.
For a smooth process and to use the zoom functionality, please use the desktop version.
